# MIDI Embeddings with BERT

This project explores the use of a BERT-based models (currently [MusicBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05630)) to generate embeddings from MIDI files. The goal is to capture rich musical features such as rhythm, melody, and harmony in a high-dimensional space, enabling various downstream applications like music retrieval, classification, and recommendation.
